## First Access

To make sure everyone has access and has some basic git knowledge I think everyone should do the following:

1. Create github account (this is already done or you wouldn't be able to view this)
2. Clone this repository somewhere that you have disk space for future expansion
3. Create a new local branch
4. In that branch add a new text file in the TestFiles folder named anything at all as long as it's unique
5. Commit and push that change
6. Open a pull request to merge branch into main

## Naming conventions

All branches, commits, and pull requests need to have descriptive names of what is being done with them. You might know what "Branch_1_3_secondtry_notfinal" is while you are working on it, but going back to see work history when something needs to be reverted is a nightmare. Trust me on this.

Example name for branch: naarkon/implement-main-menu
Clearly states who is making changes on the branch and whaat sort of changes
If a simple statement doesn't cover what you are changing, you need two branches
